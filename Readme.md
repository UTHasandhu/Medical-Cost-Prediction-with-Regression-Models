# Medical Cost Prediction with Regression Models

This project analyzes healthcare data to predict annual medical charges based on demographic and lifestyle factors.  
Developed as part of a Machine Learning course at UT Austin.  

## Features
- Preprocessed a dataset of **1,138 insurance records**, converting categorical features (sex, smoker, region) with one-hot encoding.  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis** to identify correlations between predictors (age, BMI, smoking) and charges.  
- Visualized relationships with scatter plots and boxplots to highlight key drivers of medical expenses.  
- Implemented **simple and multiple linear regression models** with scikit-learn.  
- Evaluated models using **R² and adjusted R²**, comparing predictive performance across feature sets.  

## Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Example Visualizations
- Boxplots comparing smoker vs non-smoker medical charges.  
- Scatter plots of **age vs. charges**, showing positive correlation and trends.
